# SleepyLid

This app was built to enable closed lid activity. 

Original use case was to have Spotify play to bluetooth speaker with computer lid shut. 

# How to use

The entire project was uploaded. User must have admin rights. Navigate to the Product/SleepyLid/SleepyLid.app to run. Minimize the popup window. (I couldn't figure out how to prevent it from appearing). A simple application icon should appear in the taskbar. Use is straightforward.
